# mobility-hackathon-2017
B!TS adventure at mobility hackathon 2017

This is our project for mobility hackathon 2017. We have created an Alexa Skill which is able to track the amount of City Bikes in an area and gives recommendations based on the weather, if the user should use the bike or not.
It is also able to save locations as favourite locations, so the user gets notified if there are any delays on their way to their locations.

The project got created in a timespan of ~18 hours with no sleep and a lot of alcohol, so the result is very hacky. The main reason it got created was for fun!
